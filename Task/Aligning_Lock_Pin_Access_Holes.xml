<step><note><p>Alignment between the Retaining Ring (C4) and the
threaded Lock Pin holes in the Load Ring (C3) is achieved by engaging
the Retaining Ring (C4) clockwise four complete revolutions to the
mating threads on the Lower Sub (C2) and lifting the Lower Sub with
the hoist to align the Lock Pin holes in both Retaining Ring (C4)
and Load Ring (C3) with the Locking Segment (C5).</p></note>
<cmd>Use the ¼ in. round bar to pass through the Lock Pin holes
to check for proper alignment. If necessary, use the ¼ in. flat-head
Screwdriver to rotate the Locking Segment (C5) to align its dimple
to the Lock Pin hole, see figure below.<image href = "../Images/Lock_Pin_Hole.png"
