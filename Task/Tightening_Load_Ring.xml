<prolog><author>anamika sharma</author></prolog>
<taskbody><steps><step><cmd>Locate the Load Ring (C3) and carefully
lower it onto the mating threads on the OD of the Upper Sub (C1).</cmd></step>
<step><note><p>Use an assistant to help lower the Load Ring (C3)
and to avoid pinch points.</p></note>
<cmd>Hand turn (to prevent any cross-threading) the Load Ring (C3)
in the clockwise direction at least two complete revolutions in
order to engage the threads.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Attach the appropriate size chain wrench in the uppermost
position and continue to tighten the Load Ring (C3) until the chain
wrench meets the face of the Retaining Ring (C4) that is already
mounted on the Upper Sub (C1), see figure below.<image href = "../Images/Load_Ring.png"
 height = "371.250pt" width = "317.999pt" /></cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Use the Lower Sub (C2) in combination with the chain
wrench to complete the tightening process.</cmd></step>
<step><cmd>Apply constant weight of approximately 325 lbs. to the
face of the Lower Sub (C2) in order to keep it engaged with the
mating profile on the Load Ring (C3), see figure below.<image href
= "../Images/Lower_Sub.png"  height = "415.500pt" width = "350.250pt"
/></cmd></step>
<step><note><p>Do not allow the Lower Sub (C2) profile to skip across
the mating profile due to inadequate weight as it will cause wear.</p></note>
<cmd>Ensure that the threaded Lock Pin (C6) holes in the Load Ring
(C3) are aligned with the Locking Segment (C5) once the Load Ring
(C3) is completely tightened.</cmd></step></steps></taskbody></task>
