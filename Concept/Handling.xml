<ul><li><p>ST-GL-HAL-HSE-0101 for PPE</p></li>
<li><p>GD-GL-HAL-SSS-801 for handling the equipment</p></li>
<li><p>ST-GL-HAL-HSE-0606 for proper lifting technique</p></li></ul>
<p>Ensure following points are considered while handling Quick Union

<note type = "caution"><p>Never attempt to lift a Quick Union individual
components over 35 lb. manually. Use the supplied Â½-13 UNC on the
components with a Swivel and Sling.</p></note>
<ul><li><p>If a horizontal vise use is required, use a stand to
support the assembly in a level condition and to maintain a minimum
of two points of support.</p></li>
<li><p>The assembly should only be lifted vertically. See below
for allowable methods of lifting.</p></li></ul><image href = "../Images/Quick_Union_Tool.png"
